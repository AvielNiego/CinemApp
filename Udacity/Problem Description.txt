The problem my app solves:
There is no any easy way today for searching and ordering a 
movie in the nearby theaters.
Today you need to search for a good movie in IMDB or if you 
can handle the messy interface of the Israeli theaters you 
may use their site.
Then you need to search for the hours the particular movie 
is displayed in every theater.
My app will show you the best movies and the time they are 
displayed in every single theater.
